# Scree Share

This provides an easy way to share a quadrant of your 4k monitor with MS Teams.

## Features

- Follow Mouse
- Region Indicator

## Why?

Switching between windows to share in MS Teams sucks, so I made this to allow me to dock my windows in the quadrants of my 4k monitor and share one of those quadrants. This way I can switch which quadrant is being shown with a hot key (Ctrl+Alt+r) or enable the option to follow my mouse and change to the quadrant it is currently in.

## How?

This app is built on electron. I started off with a base electron-vite app and added what was needed to get the job done.

# TTRPG Sounds

Easy to use sound board allows for you to setup scenes with repeating sounds as well as a Quick Play drawer for action sounds like bows, sword clashes, etc...

## Why?

There is a disturbing trend to make everything online. This provides a completely offline/local experience without needing to pay for anything.

## How?

This app is built on electron. I know this makes the app much larger than it would be with other tech but I know web dev and this makes the initial dev quick and the maintenance easy.
